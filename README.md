# Predicting-Vulnerable-Road-Users-Using-Stacked-LSTM-Network

Abstract— Recently, researchers have been looking into pre- dicting what pedestrians and other vulnerable road users might do. This is important for making driving systems better and safer. Most methods for this focus on how people move and plan their paths. These methods often need specific details about each situation, which makes it hard to use them in new situations. This paper talks about a new way to predict what pedestrians might do. It looks only at how pedestrians move over time. By watching a short sequence of their movements, researchers can guess where they’ll be in the future, up to 4 seconds ahead. To do this, they use a type of computer program called a neural network, specifically Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTM).The researchers tested this method using a big dataset that has different traffic situations, like busy streets. The results show that this method works well. It can predict where pedestrians will be pretty accurately, even up to 4 seconds ahead. This could help make driving safer, especially in urban areas.
